# CTA and KM3NeT Common Source Search

This repository contains the prospects for combined analyses of hadronic emission from Î³-ray sources in the Milky Way with CTA and KM3NeT/ARCA. The aim of this analysis is to simulate how well a combined analysis of CTA and KM3NeT data can differentiate between hadronic and leptonic emission scenarios of galactic gamma-ray sources. The focus is on the comparison of the combined analysis to the separate analysis of the two instruments within [Gammapy](https://docs.gammapy.org/0.17/index.html).
This content is only compatible with `gammapy v0.17`, later versions are not supported.
